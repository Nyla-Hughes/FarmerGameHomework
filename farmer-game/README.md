# Farmer Harvest Game

## How to Run
For a mac book to run this code you want to open a terminal and cd into the folder of the game
then type in this
  python3 -m http.server 8000
Then go to thi website in a browser http://localhost:8000/index.html

## Features
- Arrow functions and `.bind(this)` used to handle `this` correctly
- Different crops with different point values 
- Refactored into ES6 modules: `Game.js`, `Farmer.js`, `Crop.js` 
- Touching the scarecrow makes you loose points

I did use some AI to help with basic issues (like why the game screen was not showing up and why drawing were not popping up)
